# JacobLab_MonkeyBurst
This repo contains the necessary scripts for analyzing LFP bursts and clustering their spatiotemporal patterns. See Wang, et al., 2025

It is based on the monkey extracellular recording in PFC and VIP during a number working memory task (see [Jacob et al., 2014](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00395-X?elsca1=etoc&elsca3=0896-6273_20140702_83_1_&elsca2=email&elsca4=Cell+Press)). The data were collected by [Prof. Dr. Simon N. Jacob](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/jacob-simon) during his postdoctoral periods at the Center for Integrative Neuroscience in Tübingen.

My analytical focus was on the functional organization of monkey lPFC as revealed by spatiotemporal patterns of transient, short-life bursts in the local field potential (LFP).

# Dependencies
All analysis scripts are based on MATLAB 2018a, and should be compatible across later versions.

# Preprocessing
⚠️ the repo will be updated with necessary scripts, demos and toy data soon. Expected to be online by mid-June.
