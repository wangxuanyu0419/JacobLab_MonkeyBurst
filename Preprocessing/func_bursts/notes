different approaches to burst extraction
    - flooding: threshold, find overlapping
    - fit 2d gaussian: difficulty is finding the right initial parameters; might also take too much time
        - could use findpeaks across x and y to find initial mu
            - does find smaller peaks in between...
            - using these values as initial mu doesn't yield the correct gaussians

        - fit gaussian mixture model using lsqcurvefit!!!
            - restrict mus of peaks found by findpeaks
            - function is a combination of the gauss2drot function

to find peaks, do a lowering threshold algorithm
    if two clusters merge then fit gaussian to a very defined neighbourhood just before they merge
        how to find merges: have a list of the brightest pixel per cluster, check when it disappears
